# pyReversi
A macOS command line game of Reversi written in Python. Treats the board as an 8x8 numpy matrix and creates legal movesets/updates board by looking at individual 3x3 squares around moves or possible moves.

#### Python Version
- 3.6.0

May work in other \*nix environments besides macOS, but I haven't tested it in any others.
